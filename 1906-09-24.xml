                <head> DANGERS OF PAN-ISLAMISM </head>
                <p> In commenting on an interesting letter from
                    its correspondent in Constantinople, emphasizing
                    the dangers of the Pan-Islamic
                    agitation now going on in North Africa and
                    in Egypt, the “Birmingham Daily Post”
                    remarks that there is need for watchfulness,
                    as is made evident by Lord Cromer’s
                    Reports and by the warning uttered by
                    Sir Deward Grey shortly before the rising of
                    Parliament; but to positive facts time brings
                    us few additions that are worthy of notice.
                    Such as there are seem to be of a favourable
                    rather than of a disquieting nature. After
                    commenting upon the Sultan’s illness and
                    the unwelcome complications which his disease
                    would bring forth, our contemporary
                    continues: -We do not suggest that there
                    is cause for alarm, or even for anxiety-
                    though there may be too much for watchfulness
                    of a kind that can best be exercised through
                    the secret intelligence channels of the Egyptian
                    and Indian Governments. WE get little
                    news from Egypt; but this is not one of
                    those cases in which no news is good news.
                    The temper of an alien people is always inscrutable
                    A man who imagines himself to 
                    be a judge of character and disciplines his
                    faculties to the estimation of his fellows
                    may grossly deceive himself as to the real
                    aims and qualities of one whom he sees daily.
                    It is impossible to know the workings of the
                    mind of a secretive friend, or even of one
                    who uses candour as a veil. Still less easy
                    is it to tell what is passing in the mind of a
                    people alien in race, in mental constitution, in
                    cast of thought. The English in Egypt have
                    ever been conscious of this difficulty, but,
                    being practical men, with an ingrained racial
                    habit of doing things rather than thinking
                    about what is intangible, they have come to
                    ignore it. The things they have done have
                    been so good, and they have rightly been so well pleased with their own handiwork that they had begun to think that the Egyptians themselves were equally delighted. The Pan-Islamic agitation appears to have shattered that belief. The Egyptian accepts the benefits of English control, but there is no gratitude in him. He is an unchangeable Mahomedan, and would rather be tyrannically ruled by a despot of his own creed than be raised to the pinnacle of posterity on a basis of freedom won for him by an infidel. Hence his heart incline, to Constantinople rather than to the office of Lord Cromer at Cairo. In this is to be found the secret of his peculiar and dangerous susceptibility to an agitation fraught with risk to our ascendancy in Egypt. It is quite intelligible nature can affect surprise at it. If we English have until lately looked upon the Egyptians as beings whose hearts beat with ours, as men who had as much interest in retaining us as we have in remaining in occupation, and as having as much goodwill for us as we have for them, we have but made a characteristic national mistake. We govern other races without understanding them. We are so engrossed in the practical work of governing that we have no time to comprehend the governed. Then something occurs which brings comprehension with a flash, and we find that instead of our good administration having won us loyalty and affection, it has gained us nothing but sullen acquiescence. This is what appears to have happened in Egypt, where sullenness may, at the bidding of the Khalifa at Constantinople, develop into something worse. Indeed, if our correspondent in that capital is, as we believe him to be, a credible witness, the authorities there will do what they can to hasten the development, and not only in Egypt, but also in India.

                <p> Our Port Said contemporary, the "Verite,”
                    announces that the Otttoman Commissary has 
                    asked for a steamer to send back the mutineers 
                    to Beyroot, and that this ship is hourly expected.
                    The Suez Canal Company refuses to 
                    allow the Assyr through, as she has explosives 
                    on board. She is moored out of the way, and 
                    is watched by coast guards and marines from 
                    H.M S. Venus. </p>

                    Madhi street, and severely wounded on
                    the head, by an Italian sop-keeper. The
                    soldier had stumbled on a mat which the shop
                    keeper had left in the street, and on the
                    private blaming him for his carelessness, the
                    Italian savagely assaulted him. He is now in
                    custody.</p>
                <p> The Alhambra Theatre </p>
                <p> The performance billed for this evening at
                    the Alhambra theatre is the Geisha, and we are 
                    glad to note that it will be the occasion of
                    Signors Baldi's benefit. Signorina Baldi has 
                    contributed in no small degree to the success	
                    of this delightful musical comedy, and though 
                    we have found occasion to criticize to a certain 
                    extent her impersonation of "Mimosa San,”
                    chiefly on account of her far too slow rendering
                    of her songs in general, and the "Goldfish"
                    song in particular, we can assure those of our
                    readers who have not seen her in the role of
                    the leading Geisha of the tea-house that her
                    general presentation of the part is excellent.
                    Our best wishes for a “bumper” house. </p>

                <p> The Labban Death </p>
                <p> Doctors Disagree> </p>
                    <p> The following report concerning the death
                        of Osman Ahwed subsequent to alleged ill
                        treatment at the hands of policemen of the
                        habban caracol was supplied to us this morning
                        by the authorities of the Alexandria
                        Government.
                        In consequence of the death, which occurred
                        on the 21st inst. at the Labban police station,
                        of a native youth, against whom an aggression
                        on the part of policemen is alleged, a postmortem
                        examination was held by the police
                        medical officer, who reported that death
                        was due to natural cause, and that there
                        were no incriminating marks on the deceased's
                        body. The body was subsequently
                        transported to the Government hospital where
                        a second autopsy was held by two doctors
                        attached to the hospital, who reported that
                        death was due to heart disease, but one of the
                        doctors also expressed the opinion that death
                        might have been due to other causes. In consequence 
                        of this difference of opinion the body '
                        was submitted to a third examination by Dr.
                        Betts, director of the Government hospital,
                        who concluded that death was due to heart
                        disease and that the deceased showed signs of
                        having suffered from inflammation of the longs
                        and other internal troubles. Permission for the
                        burial of tho body was then granted by tho
                        Chef du Parquet.
                        We are also informed that, as a result of the
                        statement in our report of Saturday that the
                        man had met his death as the consequence of
                        a severe kick dealt him by an Italian onbashi
                        of police at the Labban oaracol, the Hakem-
                        darieh has written to the Parquet to ask for a
                        report of the result of the official inquiry with
                        a view to determining the responsibility of the
                        policeman. An administrative inquiry into the
                        affair has also been ordered to discover whether
                        the policemen concerned wore guilty of a
                        breach of duty. </p>

                <p> New Appointements </p>
                <p> There is some talk in French Government
                    circles of the impending retirement of M. Bernardi
                    de Sigoyer, judge of the Court of Appeal
                    at the Alexandria Mixed Tribunals, in which
                    event he would be succeeded by Judge Pruners,
                    who has for twenty-one years been the 
                    President of the Mixed Courts at Cairo
                    It is stated that Judge Satow will in all
                    probability succeed Judge Archer at the Alexandria
                    Mixed Courts owing to the latter’s 
                    retirement to take up his important new
                    Siamese appointment. The appointment of 
                    Judge Satow has not as yet been officially 
                    announced, and it will not be decided upon
                    until the return of Lord Cromer to Egypt. </p>

                <p> Relief of Khartoum Garrison </p>
                <p> The extensive army maneuvers which are
                    being carried out this summer by the troops
                    of the Army of Occupation certainly exceed in
                    interest and extent those of former years.
                    Next month the North Sudan will be the 
                    scene of operations, and our troops will be
                    charged with the relief of the Khartoum, 
                    leaving Abbassieh siding by special trains at
                    8:45 a.m. on the 13th, 17th, 22nd, and 27th

                <p> The Late Admiral Chichester</p>
                <p> Rear Admiral Sir Edward Chichester, Superintendent
                    in charge of his Majesty’s naval
                    establishments at Gibraltar, who died last week
                    first saw active service daring the Egyptian
                    Campaign of 1882, where, as lieutenant of the
                    Thalia, he won a war service promotion as 
                    commander, together with the more barren 
                    honours of the "Crippy” medal and the Khedive’s
                    Bronze Star. In 1884-85, for the Nile 
                    Expedition to Gordon's relief, it was Chichester
                    who was selected as principal transport 
                    officer, and his exertions gained for him the 
                    special thanks of the Admiralty for the perfect 
                    organization that had contributed so materially 
                    to tho celerity with which the expeditionary 
                    force and its mass of incubus had been landed. </p>

                <p> Company Meetings</p>
                <p> Egyptian Land &amp; General Trust </p>
                <p> Increasing Values Reported </p>
                <p> The annual general meeting of the Egyptian
                    Land and General Trust, Ltd., was held on
                    the 1st inst. at Winchester house. Old Broadstreet,
                    E. C., Sir William F. Haynes Smith,
                    K.C.M.G.,LLD. (tho chairman of the company)
                    presiding.
                    The Secretary having read the notice convening
                    the meeting,
                    The Chairman said: Gentlemen,—I do not
                    desire to detain you with any lengthened
                    observations. The report and accounts place
                    tho position of the company plainly before
                    you. Since the 30th of June the investments
                    grouped under the beading "Other Investments,"
                    £13,462 16s. 1d., have been realised at
                    a small profit and the amount applied in reduction
                    of the outstanding amounts due for the
                    purchase of land, which has been reduced by
                    £15,778 5. 3d. The capital of the company has
                    been invested in building lands at Cairo, at Alexandria,
                    and at Khartoum,and in each case the
                    lands have risen in value since they were purchased.
                    We wore advised that it was undesirable
                    to realise these properties within the period
                    of the accounts now laid before you; but we
                    are proceeding with the steps necessary for the
                    realisation of these properties to the best ad-
                    vantage. The Ghorbal Estate at Alexandria is
                    an exceptional property, and, as I have already
                    mentioned, it appeared, expedient, in the interests
                    of the shareholders, to refuse an offer
                    for it, which would have yielded a profit of
                    over £30,000. It would have been pleasant to
                    have been able to give to the shareholders a
                    large dividend on the first year of working, but
                    it seemed expedient, after having taken the
                    risk of purchasing this property, that the share-
                    holders should reap the full profit to be derived
                    from its proper development Its position as
                    being almost the only remaining building area
                    in Alexandria, a vast commercial centre,
                    which is daily growing in importance, appears
                    to render this property independent of the
                    ordinary fluctuations which may affect the
                    land market in Egypt. We also for similar
                    reasons declined an offer for another property,
                    which would have yielded a profit of about
                    £7,O0O. After receiving the best advice we
                    can obtain, the Board believe that these properties
                    will yield larger profits than those
                    offered, and they are taking action for the
                    purpose. </p>
                <p> New Business </p>
                <p> During the negotiations which have been
                    pending, many matters have remained in
                    abeyance which are being proceeded with.
                    Offers of new business on terms which appear
                    to be favourable are now being dealt with by
                    the Board, and there is no reason to doubt
                    that the operations of the company can be
                    made a success for the shareholders. I now beg
                    formally to move the adoption of the report
                    and accounts.
                    Mr. J. Woodrow Matthews seconded the
                    motion.
                    The Chairman invited questions, but none
                    were asked and he thereupon put the motion
                    for the adoption of the report and accounts,
                    which was carried unanimously.
                    The Chairman next moved the confirmation
                    of the appointment of Mr. E. Toriel as a director,
                    which was seconded by Mr. A. P. Mack,
                    and agreed to.
                    On the proposition of Mr. C. H. Rigg, seconded
                    by Mr. Veasey, Messrs. Annan Kirby
                    Dexter and Co. were reappointed auditors of
                    the company.
                    In acknowledging a vote of thanks, the Chair-
                    man said the duty which he had had to perform
                    at that meeting had not been very arduous, and
                    he hoped that if he had the pleasure of meeting
                    the shareholders in future similar unanimity
                    would be shown.
                    The proceedings then terminated. </p> 
                <p> The Khedive's Yacht </p>
                <p> An interesting insurance was effected at
                    Lloyd’s last week on the Khedive's pleasure
                    yacht Mahroussa. This vessel, now valued at
                    £100,000, has, as we recently reported, been
                    entirely reconstructed, having been fitted on
                    the Clyde with three of the most modern steam
                    turbines and otherwise converted from a paddle
                    into a screw steamer. The previous Thursday
                    she succeessfully ran her official trial trip in the
                    Firth of Clyde and attained a speed over a
                    measured distance of 17.75 knots. The present
                    insurance covers the yacht against all maritime
                    perils on her voyage out to Alexandria, via
                    Gibraltar and Constantinople, at which latter
                    port it is anticipated that the Khedive will go
                    on board.
                    Until the vessel is officially delivered she is
                    in the hands of the contractors, who have
                    provided in the insurance contract that the
                    yacht will be navigated as far as Gibraltar in
                    the charge of a special pilot. Seeing that the
                    Mabroussa was originally built of iron on the
                    Thames as long ago as 1865, some underwriters
                    have been surprised that she was worth the
                    enormous amount spent upon her reconstruction, 
                    but they are unanimous in considering
                    her a first-class risk for the voyage out, as she
                    is practically an entirely new yacht, inferior
                    probably to no other pleasure craft of the same
                    type afloat. The Mabroussa is not the first yacht
                    built for a distinguished potentate which has
                    been insured in London. Some time ago after
                    the Sultan of Turkey’s new yacht was constructed
                    on the Tyne, she was insured for her
                    maiden voyage to the Mediterranean for
                    £80,000. </p> <cb/>
                <p> Alexandria-Marseilles </p>
                <p> A 75 Hours' Passage. </p>
                <p> The Egyptian Mail Steamship Company
                    Limited is pushing on the construction of its
                    fleet for its service between Marseilles and
                    Alexandria, and the first of its turkine steamers
                    will be ready to be launched next May. Lady
                    Cromer has been asked to christen the first
                    steamer and to preside at the ceremony of
                    launching, which will take place next summer.
                    The service between Marseilles and Alexandria
                    will begin to run from the 15th October, 1907.
                    The steamers are being built Fairfield's.
                    The time occupied by these turbine steamers
                    in the passage between Marseilles and Alexandria
                    will not exceed seventy five hours. The
                    steamers after leaving Marseilles will call at
                    Tania, and this will be the only port of call
                    on the journey. It is expected that the
                    passenger service between Marseilles and Tunis
                    will be a lucrative asset of the Company, as
                    now there is no first class line of passenger
                    steamers plying between Franco and Tunis.
                    The Egyptian Mail Steamship Company will
                    be under contract with the Egyptian Government
                    to carry the mails from London to
                    Cairo in one hundred hours. The present
                    mail service by way of Brindisi and Port
                    Said frequently exceeds this limit oven
                    when there are no untoward circumstances
                    in transit. A special train in connection
                    with the steamers will be run by the Internationstional
                    Sleeping Car Company from Calais
                    by Paris to Marseilles. At Paris these express
                    trains will connect with part of the trains
                    from Belgium, Germany, and the north. The
                    steamers will fly the Egyptian flag. </p>

                <p> Rich Copper Deposits </p>
                <p> Rich new deposits of copper have been found
                    in the north of Rhodesis, and as a result of
                    the discovery it has been decided to proceed at
                    once with another extension of the Cape to-
                    Cairo railway.
                    The line, which has reached Broken Hill, is
                    now to be carried a hundred miles further
                    north, to Bwana N’Kubwa, in the vicinity of
                    which there is said to be great mineral wealth.
                    This extension will take the railway close to
                    the Congo State border, and it is believed that
                    in a few years it will be continued to the
                    southern shores of Lake Tanganyika. The
                    extension will also facilitate the linking up of
                    the Rhodesian lines with the new railway,which
                    is to traverse the Congo State from Lobita Bay.</p>

                <p> In their weekly report upon the cotton
                    market Messrs. Collinge Brothers remark that
                    tho chief feature this week has been the
                    bureau report of Monday giving the condition
                    on the 25th ulto. as 77.3 against 82.9 last
                    month. This was a lower figure than had been
                    anticipated in general and in conjunction with
                    the deterioration news which had been received
                    after the 25th ulto, caused considerable
                    covering by "shorts." There has, however, been
                    but little real "bull” support and we are
                    against the market for the long ran in view
                    of the facts that the South has been offering
                    more freely lately, crop news again reads
                    favorably in general and that an increased
                    crop movement may shortly be expected. </p>

                    Cette situation se traduit par one baisse
                    presque générale de la cote, sans qu'il y ait en,

                    and a lace yoke and sleeves and she wore a

                <p> The Advance of Egypt </p>
                <p> Financial Activity </p>
                <p> M. de Reffye, French Consul at Cairo, in an
                    interesting article to “L’lnformation" on the
                    economic situation in Egypt, remarks upon
                    the financial activity in Egypt during the
                    year 1905-6, when quite a number of companies
                    came into being in Cairo, and furnished the
                    occasion for the introduction of a large amount
                    of foreign capital. He divides the companies
                    into land, financial, industrial, commercial,
                    transport and hotel companies. There are other
                    two branches not included in this list—namely,
                    land mortgage, in which French capital plays
                    the moat important role, and those companies
                    with registered offices abroad—principally in
                    London, Paris and Belgium, which are governed
                    by their respesctive national laws, and which
                    he has failed to find out much about. It is
                    difficult to determine what is the proportion
                    of capital subscribed by foreigners and natives
                    respectively in those companies which have
                    been issued in Egypt, for the foreign element
                    amongst their shareholders is resident in the
                    land, and cannot be easily sorted out. Eleven
                    land companies were founded in 1905 and
                    three in 1906, with a capital of 113,500,000f.,
                    and the contribution of the Egyptians thereto,
                    always admitting the uncertainty named above,
                    was about 84,500,000f. France shared to the
                    extent of about 4,500,000f, whilst French-
                    men in Egypt contributed about 780,000f.
                    Other races took part as follows:—English,
                    7,070,000f; Anglo Egyptians, 15,700,000f;
                    Belgians, 11,276,00f; and Dutch 2,000,000f,
                    Two financial companies were established,
                    whose combined capital was 17,500,000f, which
                    was taken up in Egypt There was but one
                    "industrial," a cigarette company, in 1905,
                    with 625,000 fr. capital, of which Germany
                    subscribed 325,000f, England 125,000f, and the
                    balance was made up by Germans in Egypt
                    or by pure Egyptians; but in 1906 there have
                    been five such companies, with a combined
                    capital of 4,500,000f, almost entirely locally
                    subscribed by English and Belgians, except for
                    550,000f, subscribed by Austrians. There were
                    six commercial companies with relatively small
                    capital, subscribed to almost entirely by the

                    likewise six transport companies, with about
                    4,130,000f capital The total companies established
                    were five, with a combined capital of

                    Egyptians, Syrians and English were large
                    contributors. The disposition is strong, he

                    land companies, and particularly so in
                    the case of the French. </p>

                <p> The following	are the results	 of the race on

                <!-- NEED TO INSERT A TABLE TEMPLATE HERE -->
                <p> The wind was fresh from the N.W., and a
                    very pretty start was witnessed, nearly all the
                    boats being over the line within a few seconds
                    after the starting gun was fired. The largest
                    boats soon drew	 away from the smaller, until it
                    became a following race. </p>
                <p> The following	are the results the race on
                    rating which wa	s held yesterday: </p>
                <!-- NEED TO INSERT A TABLE TEMPLATE HERE -->
                <p> Yesterday only five boats turned up. The
                    “Calypso” did not race on account of her old
                    sails, which are quite worn out. The "Minnie"
                    leaked so badly in the first race that it was
                    not worth her while starting on the second one.
                    The Isis II. very pluckily started in both races,
                    and continued to the end of each. </p>
                <p> Above are given both the actual finish and
                    the corrected times according to the allowance
                    made for rating. It will be seen that the
                    Anake was first in each case; she therefore
                    wins the cup. The Sans Pareille was very
                    unlucky in each race; in the first one she
                    made a bad start, and in the second one when
                    halfway round the first round she carried
                    away her jib, which split right up, being apparently
                    very old. This was most unfortunate
                    as she was fighting well with the Ananke
                    for first place. The Fen Follet did not come up
                    to what was expected of her, being beaten by
                    the Ananke in the first race by approximately
                    4 1/2 minutes and in the second by approximately
                    8 1/2 minutes; her sail does not appear to be as
                    well stretched as it might be. The Banshee did
                    very well in the second race in comparison with
                    the only other local built boat, viz Fen-Follet,
                    only being beaten by her by 1 min. 26 secs,which
                    difference no doubt is due to her being the
                    older boat. </p>
                    <p> Owing to an error in last Wednesday’s
                    report of the results of the races the Fen-Follet
                    was omitted. She also had the misfortune
                    of dropping part of her crew overboard, but
                    they we repicked successfully and no damage
                    done. </p> <cb/>
